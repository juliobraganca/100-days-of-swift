# Project 22 - Detect-a-Beacon

unfortunately this apps needs to have physical devices for testing, which I was able to do but not take other screenshots. I encourage you to download the code and test in your iphone!

## Topics

iBeacons, Core Location, CLBeaconRegion

## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/22/4/wrap-up):
>1. Write code that shows a UIAlertController when your beacon is first detected. Make sure you set a Boolean to say the alert has been shown, so it doesn’t keep appearing.
>2. Go through two or three other iBeacons in the Detect Beacon app and add their UUIDs to your app, then register all of them with iOS. Now add a second label to the app that shows new text depending on which beacon was located.
>3. Add a circle to your view, then use animation to scale it up and down depending on the distance from the beacon – try 0.001 for unknown, 0.25 for far, 0.5 for near, and 1.0 for immediate. You can make the circle by adding an image, or by creating a view that’s 256 wide by 256 high then setting its layer.cornerRadius to 128 so that it’s round.
