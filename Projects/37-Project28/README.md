# Project 28 - Secret Swift

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/92

## Topics

Biometrics authentication, Touch ID, Face ID, iOS keychain

## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/28/5/wrap-up):
>1. Add a Done button as a navigation bar item that causes the app to re-lock immediately rather than waiting for the user to quit. This should only be shown when the app is unlocked.
>2. Create a password system for your app so that the Touch ID/Face ID fallback is more useful. You'll need to use an alert controller with a text field like we did in project 5, and I suggest you save the password in the keychain!
>3. Go back to [project 10](https://github.com/juliobraganca/100-days-of-swift/tree/main/Projects/13-Project10) and add biometric authentication so the user’s pictures are shown only when they have unlocked the app. You’ll need to give some thought to how you can hide the pictures – perhaps leave the array empty until they are authenticated?
