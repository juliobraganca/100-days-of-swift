## Challenge

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/7/3/challenge):
>Itâ€™s time to put your skills to the test and make your own app, starting from a blank canvas. This time your challenge is to make a shooting gallery game using SpriteKit: create three rows on the screen, then have targets slide across from one side to the other. If the user taps a target, make it fade out and award them points.
