# Milestone Projects 10-12 - Photo captions

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/50

## Challenge

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/5/3/challenge):
>Your challenge is to put two different projects into one: Iâ€™d like you to let users take photos of things that interest them, add captions to them, then show those photos in a table view. Tapping the caption should show the picture in a new view controller, like we did with project 1. So, your finished project needs to use elements from both project 1 and project 12, which should give you ample chance to practice.
