## Topics

## Challenges

>1. Modify [project 1](https://github.com/juliobraganca/100-days-of-swift/tree/main/Projects/Project%2001) so that loading the list of NSSL images from our bundle happens in the background. Make sure you call reloadData() on the table view once loading has finished!
>2. Modify [project 8](https://github.com/juliobraganca/100-days-of-swift/tree/main/Projects/Project%2008) so that loading and parsing a level takes place in the background. Once you’re done, make sure you update the UI on the main thread!
>3. Modify project 7 (Current folder) so that your filtering code takes place in the background. This filtering code was added in one of the challenges for the project, so hopefully you didn’t skip it!

Please check inside the codes of each project to see the GCD implemented.
