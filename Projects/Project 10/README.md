# Project 10 - Names to faces

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/42

## Topics

UICollectionView, UIImagePickerController, NSObject

## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/10/7/wrap-up):
>1. Add a second UIAlertController that gets shown when the user taps a picture, asking them whether they want to rename the person or delete them.
>2. Try using picker.sourceType = .camera when creating your image picker, which will tell it to create a new image by taking a photo. This is only available on devices (not on the simulator) so you might want to check the return value of UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable() before trying to use it!
>3. [Challenge 3](Challenge3/)
