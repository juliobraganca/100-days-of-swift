## Challenge

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/8/3/challenge):
>Have you ever heard the phrase, “imitation is the highest form of flattery”? I can’t think of anywhere it’s more true than on iOS: Apple sets an extremely high standard for apps, and encourages us all to follow suit by releasing a vast collection of powerful, flexible APIs to work with.
>
>Your challenge for this milestone is to use those API to imitate Apple as closely as you can: I’d like you to recreate the iOS Notes app. I suggest you follow the iPhone version, because it’s fairly simple: a navigation controller, a table view controller, and a detail view controller with a full-screen text view.
