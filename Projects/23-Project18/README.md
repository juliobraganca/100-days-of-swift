# Project 18 - Debugging

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/64

This project does not have much of an interface, the goal was to practice debugging.

## Topics

Debugging

## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/18/6/wrap-up):
>1. Temporarily try adding an exception breakpoint to project 1, then changing the call to instantiateViewController() so that it uses the storyboard identifier “Bad” – this will fail, but your exception breakpoint should catch it.
>2. In project 1, add a call to assert() in the viewDidLoad() method of DetailViewController.swift, checking that selectedImage always has a value.
>3. Go back to project 5, and try adding a conditional breakpoint to the start of the submit() method that pauses only if the user submits a word with six or more letters.
