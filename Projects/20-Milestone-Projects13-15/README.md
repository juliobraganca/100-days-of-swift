## Challenge

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/6/3/challenge):
>Your challenge is to make an app that contains facts about countries: show a list of country names in a table view, then when one is tapped bring in a new screen that contains its capital city, size, population, currency, and any other facts that interest you. The type of facts you include is down to you â€“ Wikipedia has a huge selection to choose from.
