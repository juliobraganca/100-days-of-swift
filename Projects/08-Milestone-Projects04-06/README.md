## Challenge

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/3/3/challenge):
>It’s time to put your skills to the test by making your own complete app from scratch. This time your job is to create an app that lets people create a shopping list by adding items to a table view.

>For bonus points, add a left bar button item that clears the shopping list – what method should be used afterwards to make the table view reload all its data?
